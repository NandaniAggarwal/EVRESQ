# EV RESQ

# Innovation and creativity:

We are currently in first year so we have made our project with some features such as:
Allow EV owners to request emergency charging assistance through a website and the drivers can see the requests and accept requests and charge the EV owners's vehicle.

In future we would made the following updates in our website when we will learn required technologies.
Match the stranded vehicle with a nearby rescue vehicle equipped with a mobile charging unit.
Charging Options Based on Speed and Power.
AR highlights the exact charging port location for different EV models. Shows animations for inserting and locking the charger.
Facilitate payment and transaction processing for the charging service.
Ensure safe and efficient charging within 5-10 minutes.
Use AI to predict battery drain locations and position rescue vehicles strategically.

# Business model

On-demand charging rescue with per visit pricing.
Premium pricing for faster response times or remote areas.
Tie-ups with EV fleets, ride-sharing companies, and delivery services for emergency charging.
EV manufacturers and energy companies can sponsor mobile charging units.

# Impact of our website 

By promoting EV adoption, the service contributes to lower emissions compared to traditional gasoline vehicles.
Mobile charging services encourage more people to switch to EVs, helping to reduce overall pollution.
As EVs become mainstream, reducing reliance on fossil fuels.
By operating mobile charging units and providing on-site assistance, these services create opportunities for drivers to be part of the expanding electric mobility sector.
EV owners, especially those in remote areas, gain confidence in long-distance travel with mobile charging assistance 
By providing real-time assistance, the service raises awareness about the benefits of EVs and electric mobility

# Competitions:
"Our app is like the only charger in a desert—no competition, just pure innovation!"
And this is our USP..
